  <h1>Java OOP and Design Patterns</h1>
</div>

This repository follows the classes and didactics of the course [Java One For All](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0Un1HNdB4jGKw5szJrQETqJTlZKyKReu).

[Oracle Docs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/index.html) are also used as a source of information and knowledge.

### Why?

The goal is to get a decent comprehension of the Java Language and the most essential Computer Science concepts.

Following the Java essentials, this repository will also be part of my studies of **Design Patterns** and **Spring Framework**.
